# Pleasure at the Car Wash

## December 24, 2018

Have you noticed that in moments of pure hedonistic pleasure, funny things sometimes pop out of 
our mouths? Take today at the car wash, for instance (and if you think there isn’t hedonistic pleasure 
to be had at the car wash, then you aren’t doing it right). Christmas shopping was done. I had just 
driven the car through the auto-wash, which is fun all on its on. I pulled into the free-vacuum stall, got out, 
and grabbed the suction hose. With a smile, I ran the hose through my hair and all over my scalp. There was that clean, 
cool sensation of air flowing over my sweaty head skin. Ahhhhhhh. Trust me on this. Try it next time you are at the car wash. 
You’ll never be the same. And neither will the lady next to me. I looked over at the next stall, and a lady was watching me 
in amazement. Then it popped out of my mouth. I smiled and said “head lice”. With a single word, “nice”, she quickly got in her 
car and left me to my vacuum.
