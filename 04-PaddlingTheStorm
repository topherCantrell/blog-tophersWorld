# Paddling in the Storm

## July 9, 2018

Twenty second day of April in the year of 2015. Half past six in the evening.

Thar I bein’. She were a fine afternoon. I was a stretchin’ me oars in my yeller dinghy, JoJo. We 
put in at Ditto Landing, and we were just roundin the east horn of Hobbs Island when it struck. A damp wind 
blew up from the west and the sky grew fierce dark. Lightin’ snaked across the sky and the thunder rolled off 
the roiling, black water. I stowed me shirt in the fo’c’sle and turned JoJo into the wind.

The wind-driven rain stang me naked chest, and I bellowed out the storm orders: abandon the crow, lash the long 
sail, cover the bung hole. But it were only me and JoJo against the storm. Aye, it was the very breath of Davy Jones 
blowing water over the starboard side. And thar on the bank stood Gordon Lightfoot taking notes.

Once the storm front passed it were a gloomy paddle back around to the dock. We sang dirges in the rain. The song 
goes that she Tim-Tebows on the rain. But I can tell ye for sure that she rains on me and JoJo.
