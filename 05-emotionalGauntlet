# Emotional Gauntlet at Chick-fil-a

## October 19, 2018

Have you noticed the line of orange traffic cones at your local Chick-fil-a? It is supposed to divert cars around the building to make my dining experience more controlled, efficient, and pleasant. But what it really does is create a horrible emotional gauntlet that my soul must run before breakfast.

The ordeal begins as soon as I pull into the parking lot. That blue Ford Focus in front of me just whipped around the cones instead of going around the building! When we get our driver’s license they should issue us referee flags to throw. The sign says to circle the building!

Or maybe I got there early, and there isn’t another car in line. I could ease around that cone and get my biscuit so much faster. I have been known to do that. But no, not today. Today I’m a law abiding citizen! I puff out my chest and proudly strut my car around the building. But I’m looking in the rear view mirror the whole time. Will someone else go around the cones and get in front of me?

Oh no! There’s the bread truck parked on the other side of the building. (Or maybe it’s Thursday, and the garbage truck has the road blocked). I have to twist my way around the obstacles. There is a slow family crossing the drive back to their car. Please, kid, don’t drop your coat. I wonder if the cones on the other side of the building have increased the danger to pedestrians on this side — people race around to get in line before getting cut off.

I can see the entrance to the cone-lane now, and I slouch down in my seat and creep slowly around the corner. What fun it would be to actually catch someone in the act of dodging the cones and cutting me off! Ah ha! Caught you! I could toot my horn (not a full blow, mind you) and give them the “what the heck” hands-up sign. I could glare at them all the way through the line.

But nobody is there. I’m in the lane, and I’m watching behind me to see who has the gall to sneak around the cones. Dangit! There’s that same dark-headed kid from last week!

Finally, I get my food. They better not have put cheese on that sausage-egg biscuit. I’ll deal with that surprise later. Right now I have to get around the corner of the building for another shot at catching some inconsiderate butt stealing time from others by going around the cones. I might just get back in line behind them with glares and sighs and hands. I wish we hadn’t given up throwing poop at each other.

Ha! What luck! Just as I come around the edge of the building there is a lady in a white car waiting for me to go by so she can duck around the cones. I am blocking the entrance to the cone lane now. I smile and wave her on around — I’m the nice guy letting her go first. She points to the cone in front of me to tell me she wants to go in there. OH NO YOU DON’T I think! I hold my index finger up and make a circular motion. You have to circle the building, lady. And she does.

Then I am back on the highway at last. I’m too emotionally exhausted to eat right now. I’ll let myself settle down for a few minutes before enjoying my breakfast (assuming there is no cheese on it).
