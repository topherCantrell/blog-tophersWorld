# On the Origin of Code Quality by Means of Natural Selection

## July 12, 2017

A C++ developer has a much harder time being born than a Java developer does. The fledgling C++ programmer must survive hostile environments 
filled with tedious configurations for libraries and include paths. The development venue is traditionally a unix/linux box that encourages 
tool chains fraught with cryptic command lines. Sigh. Building a C++ application is not for the faint-of-heart.

Java developers, on the other hand, live a pampered life of luxury with bright, colorful IDEs that pop up with fixes and suggestions faster 
than a Microsoft paperclip in a fourth grade history report. I can crank out giant web applications with one hand and a few mouse clicks without 
spilling my fruity beverage in the other hand.

You would think this barrier to entry for C++ would weed out all but the fittest developers. The average C++ program should be more elegant than 
the average Java program simply because only the crème de la crème of C++ developers survive to write code. Yet I have seen little difference in 
the quality of code between easy-and-hard-to-write languages.

The reason is that a developer has a limited number of neurons. The complexities of tools and syntax in C++ consume valuable mental resources leaving 
fewer neurons available to craft the code itself. Good programmers usually produce good code, but their riches are heavily taxed by the development 
environment. Bad programmers usually create bad code, but in Java they can crank it out faster.

Remember the movie Idiocracy? Intelligent parents tend to wait later in life to have children, and they have fewer (quality) children. Meanwhile
the idiots are spawning like rabbits. Their drooling, dull-eyed progeny spread like weeds.

I see the same trend in code technology. Carefully crafted programs (in whatever language you choose) take time to create. They are being smothered 
by shoddy, half-assed applications simply because they get to market first. Soon the code-guru will be standing on the side of the road with 
a “will code for food” sign while web developers will be racing home to see another episode of “Oww, my balls!”
