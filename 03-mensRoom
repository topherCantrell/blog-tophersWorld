# Then Men's Room

## May 24, 2018

Gay, lesbian, male, female, transgender, black, white, old, young — the 99.9% of us in the normal population agree with one thing: nobody 
wants to see male privates. Yes, there are the extreme exceptionals for which we have the “do not eat the toner” labels.

But if you’ve ever been in a “men’s room” then you know it isn’t an open celebration of being male where men ditch their pants at the door 
and walk around in blissful freedom. Quite the opposite. Men pick the most isolate urinal they can, and they carefully expose the bare minimum 
while they do their business. Is that a purple gorilla or space alien next to you? Nobody knows … because nobody looks left or right while 
standing there.
