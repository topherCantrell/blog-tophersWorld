# Programming isn't Fun

## May 7, 2018

There is nothing “fun” about writing code. It is a miserable, frustrating process filled with curse words and hair pulling. Developers 
shout “why isn’t this working? You stupid loop! Why is this parameter null? Jason, will you PLEASE stop tapping your pencil, you are 
driving me NUTS!”.

Writing code is a stressful, physical exercise where the human wrings the functionality out of the computer like twisting dirty water 
from a dish-rag. Why do we do it? It’s the thrill of solving the problem — the challenge — having made it to the top of the mountain. 
Nobody thinks climbing the mountain is fun, do they? It’s all about reaching the top. That’s how it is with writing code.

I need to be ALONE where I can focus and get in the zone. I need dual screen monitors to hold all my inter-related code windows. I need 
a real mouse and a clicky-mechanical keyboard. Now, picture a developer sitting cross-legged on a bench in the woods with a phone texting 
code and smiling — one with nature and happiness. I’m sorry, people. This NEVER happens.

And yet:
